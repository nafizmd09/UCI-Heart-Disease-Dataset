# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

In this project, we'll explore the application of machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease based on patients' medical attributes. We'll follow a structured methodology, starting with problem understanding and concluding with model evaluation. Let's delve into the details:

## Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases remain a significant cause of mortality worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis are critical for effective treatment and prevention. Machine learning offers a promising approach for predicting heart disease using patient data.

## Data
We'll utilize the Heart Disease UCI dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains diverse medical features like age, gender, cholesterol levels, and exercise-induced angina, along with a target variable indicating heart disease presence or absence.

## Problem Statement
Our aim is to develop a machine learning model that accurately determines whether a patient has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

## Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the dataset to understand feature distributions and discover correlations or patterns.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance model performance.
4. **Model Selection:** Experimenting with various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing each model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of selected models to optimize performance.
7. **Cross-validation:** Evaluating model performance using cross-validation to ensure generalizability.
8. **Feature Importance:** Identifying the most influential features in predicting heart disease.
9. **Final Model Selection:** Choosing the best-performing model for deployment.
10. **Experimentation:** Iterating on the model and exploring alternative approaches to enhance performance.

## Conclusion
Through systematic experimentation and evaluation, our goal is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting heart disease. This project underscores the potential of machine learning techniques in healthcare for improved diagnosis and patient care.
